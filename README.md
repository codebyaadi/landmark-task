## Getting Started

To start a project and running follow these simple steps.

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the `backend` directory:

    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```

2. Install backend dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the backend server:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    This will start the Express server on port `8080`.

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory:

    ```bash
    cd ../frontend
    ```

2. Install frontend dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the frontend development server:

    ```

    This will start the React development server and open the application in your default web browser.
